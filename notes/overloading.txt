What is overloading?

Methods with the SAME NAME that have DIFFERENT PARAMETERS or are called "overloaded" methods.
Methods cannot be overloaded through their RETURN TYPE -
Methods with the same name, different parameters but different return type CANNOT be overloaded.

Why do we overload methods?
Case: General methods
- Consistent naming

Case: Constructors
- avoiding unnecessary "setter" methods
- easier to create objects (without being too verbose)


Other stuff:
- Constructors can be overloaded
