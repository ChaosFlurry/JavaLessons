What is overriding?
The term overriding is used when talking about methods, specifically, two methods with the same SIGNATURE that appear in both the superclass and a subclass.
When we say that a method overrides another, we mean that the method in the SUBCLASS "replaces" the method in the superclass the method is called.
That is to say, when an instance method of a subclass is called, even though a method with the same signature appears in the superclass, the method in the subclass is used instead.


Overriding toString() and equals()
Every class (object) is a subclass of Object, which means that every class inherits the toString() and equals() methods from Object.
However, these methods (from the superclass Object) often don't work properly when called by instances of created classes.
To fix this, we can override the toString() and equals() methods in our classes to make them work properly.
